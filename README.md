# Uhh, Hi?
I'm Tan, the guy who made that one Malaysia COVID-19 tracker on Twitter and other stuffs that you might be interested at. Actually, I'm writing in Batch (during programming), some HTML and CSS programming (for websites) and Elementor / Wordpress editing (for another website).

Most of the Python projects (except for covidcases) started as a Batch script (including WSAUtilities, archived), then migrated to Python because I found that it can do more stuff than batch scripts.
  
(Yeah, I also made YouTube videos that isn't regarding stuffs about programming, but other stuffs, maybe take a look at it [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/OogaChakaOogaOoga)?)

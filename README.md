### For those who are wondering why there's no commits except for auto commits done by `yttestlabs`, `covidcases` and EPG updates
Currently studying for exams. Might be back at 15th of April.
# Uhh, Hi?
I'm Tan, the guy who made WSAUtilities and other stuffs that you might be interested at. Actually, I'm writing in Batch (during programming), some HTML and CSS programming (for websites) and Elementor / Wordpress editing (for another website). ~~This guy just used batch scripts for everything, and it worked pretty well?~~
